âœ… COMPLETED: Fixed cart total race condition - rapid quantity changes now cancel previous API calls, preventing slow incremental updates

[review] updating cart from all pages i can think of that touch cart

[review] moved css to top of some pages, cause i was getting some weird pop in thing on cart after the DOM change stuff. Moving it to top fixed issue. 

[discuss] the iOS zoom on tap stuff happens when font size is under 16px. We can get around it by disabling zoom on page. This may impact accessability, but i cannot find any specific requirements for zoom, or pinch zoom on the theme requirements page. It is specifically mentioned under their "gesture support accessability best practices" though: https://shopify.dev/docs/storefronts/themes/best-practices/accessibility

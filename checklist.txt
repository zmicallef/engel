before we move onto requirements checklist i wanna iron out a couple issues that i cannot figure out lol 

* having issues with the remove from cart button, sometimes it removes other variants other than the one clicked ?? i am unsure
e.g. the first coat with the size variants, if you add multiple sizes/colours and click remove in cart it sometimes removes multiple

* would be good to have a button that removes 1 from the cart, unsure how to do this 

* i want to add auto currency detection if possible, might require a cookies popup???

* want to add shipping estimate thingy to cart page 

i think thats it for current, once all thats implemented we can start handing it out and get feedback as we dev

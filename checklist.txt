[review] final thing i can think of is on add to cart / remove from cart i have it setup with an async wait function so that it has time to update before force refresh. idk if this is a good way to do it?? seems like there's probably a better way

[review] updating cart from all pages i can think of that touch cart

[review] moved css to top of some pages, cause i was getting some weird pop in thing on cart after the DOM change stuff. Moving it to top fixed issue.
